Hi everyone, I'm TypicRavager, a noob developer. I don't know much about computer science and programming but I'm hoping to learn by uploading every so often to github so please be too critical.
I barely know my way around the website so please don't be surprised when/if I start moving things around.
That being said, I introduce to you my basic python cmakelists generating script. I have been learning a bi of cmake and learning sfml and sdl and will be changin computers soon so I don't want the headache
This gave birth to this script. It currently only supports sfml and sdl2 but I'm hoping to extend its modularity and the libraries it can generate txt files for. In the future,
I'm hoping to be able to give users the ability to configure exactly what components they want from each library, and add more library support like dearImGui, WxWidgets etc.
So, uh, I made an oopsie I cant figure out for some reason but my head tells me it's mistake. When adding path to one of SDL prompts, it will sometimes say wrong input. The way to solve this is to
swap backslash (\) with forward slash(/)
I made this with windows in mind. I don't know anything about linux or mac but it might work? please give suggestions if you can about how I may make it cross platform compatible
Again, this is basic but it still helps newbies like me. Happy coding!
